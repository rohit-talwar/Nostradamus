What it is
----------

Using the structure of ClassifierStructure.h, I have completed the class
definitions in python.

Use the same datasets performed 5-fold cross-validation on each dataset. 
i.e., divide the dataset into 5 non-overlapping partitions (using the 
splitDataset() function) and in each fold, test using one of the folds 
while training using the other four. Reported the average error, standard 
deviation of error and the confusion matrix.

Implemented the above using the given strategies in the classifier structure 
given different learning algorithms and different combination strategies.
