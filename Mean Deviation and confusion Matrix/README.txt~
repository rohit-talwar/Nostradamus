Here I perform 5-fold cross-validation on each dataset. i.e., divide the 
dataset into 5 non-overlapping partitions (using the splitDataset() function) 
and in each fold, test using one of the folds while training using the
other four. Report the average error, standard deviation of error
and the confusion matrix.
