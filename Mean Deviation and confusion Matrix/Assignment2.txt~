	Submission: Answers as a pdf file. Answers and code to be
          uploaded to the portal in a zip file.


1. Implement the linear classifier learning algorithms that was
   covered in the class. Use the class and function structure given.
   The structure is given in C++, but you are free to use Java/Python
   with the same structure. If you are using C++, complete the class
   definitions in the .h file and use a .cpp file to implement them.
   You may use any matrix library such as Newmat or Armadillo.


2. Use the same datasets you used for Assignment 1, and perform 5-fold
   cross-validation on each dataset. i.e., divide the dataset into 5
   non-overlapping partitions (using the splitDataset() function) and
   in each fold, test using one of the folds while training using the
   other four. Report the average error, standard deviation of error
   and the confusion matrix.

   Perform the above using at-least two different learning algorithms and
   two different combination strategies. Give detailed report of the
   results and your observations on them.

3. Prove that the single sample relaxation algorithm with fixed
   margin will converge to a solution if one exists.

4. Give an example of a 2-D classification problem with two classes
   where the pseudo-inverse method fails due to singularity of the
   matrix to be inverted.
