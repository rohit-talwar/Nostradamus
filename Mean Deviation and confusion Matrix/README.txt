Here I perform 5-fold cross-validation on each dataset. i.e., divide the 
dataset into 5 non-overlapping partitions (using the splitDataset() function) 
and in each fold, test using one of the folds while training using the
other four. Report the average error, standard deviation of error
and the confusion matrix.

Run the final.py present in the data folders to see the results. 

final.py can be used to train for other datasets by making small adjustments
according to the data present in the data files.
